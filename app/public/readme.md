all the public files and nothing else
Same thing here: everything is grouped by components. We have the folder for the 404 error, the folder for the home page etc
I wasn't sure about this but I did it anyway.

Also, even if it's not recognized as a good practice, I have a folder that is shared between other files. In there there are just styiling stuff and a function that is needed everywhere. I didn't want to make multiple copies of it.
