this is the core aspect of this template where everything is structured by components.
Instead of having the routes, controllers, models folder instead we have everything groubed by components.
For example the user folder will contain everyhting related to the user: routes, controllers, models etc.

There's the api folder, the index for the homepage, the date and the user.
NOTE: the user folder is empty, it's just for making an example
